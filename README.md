What If ? 

A 2D Side-Scrolling Narrative Platformer

📖 Concept

What If ? is a 2D side-scrolling platformer built in Unity that explores perspective, empathy, and the evolution of societal roles through time.

The game presents a role-reversal world, a world where a women plays the mans roles in society and vice versa , where players experience historical and modern challenges symbolizing the physical, emotional, and social burdens traditionally associated with women — but embodied through a male protagonist.

Rather than delivering a direct message, the game uses gameplay mechanics, environment design, and symbolic obstacles to encourage reflection.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Players progress through multiple eras, each representing shifts in civilization and social structures:

1️⃣ Survival Era – Nature, endurance, sustainability
2️⃣ Kingdom / Medieval Era – Hierarchy, duties, restrictions
3️⃣ Industrial Era – Labor pressure, exhaustion, productivity
4️⃣ Modern Era – Bias, balance, identity

Each era introduces thematic reinterpretations of core mechanics while maintaining consistent gameplay logic.
